# code-comment-ai-test
Test app for automatically commenting code using generative AI

Before running: 
1. Create a copy of .env.txt
2. Replace the text between quotes with your OpenAI API key
3. Save the copy as .env in the root directory

You may optionally run the start.bat file to run the app and this will automatically create a venv for this app.
